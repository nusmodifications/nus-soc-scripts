NUS Scripts
=================

### Introduction

A collection of scripts to make the life of NUS students easier and better.

- **Claims**
  - Helpful script for any SoC undergrad tutors to submit their claims in the teaching claims portal for repetitive claims.
  - Provides tutors with a convenient way of adding weekly repetitive claims into the portal via short snippets of code, rather
    than adding each claim activiy manually which is extremely tedious.
- **Exam Paper Downloader**
  - Download all exam papers from the library archive for a module.
  - Check out [NUS Exams Downloader](https://github.com/nusmodifications/nus-exams-downloader) for a native app wrapper version.
- **IVLE Photos / Know Your Classmates** (No longer functional)
  - IVLE doesn't show the photos of your classmates.
  - This script will let you see the photos of your classmates in SoC modules.
- **Google Scripts**
  - Useful scripts powered by [Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/)
  - These scripts will send your personal notification about module, singtel and so on.
